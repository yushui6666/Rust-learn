“The River of Moments”

Time drifts like a river through the silent vale,
Each ripple a whisper, each current a tale.
Morning wakes with a golden sigh,
And evening folds beneath a crimson sky.

Footsteps fade on the path of years,
Moments carved from laughter and tears.
The wind hums softly through the old oak tree,
Carrying secrets of what was, and what will be.

Stars awaken in the velvet night,
Guiding the dreamers with silver light.
Shadows linger, then fade away,
Chasing the edges of yesterday.

Hearts collide like meteors in the dark,
Leaving behind a luminous spark.
Time bends and twists, never still,
A constant tide, against our will.

Voices echo in corridors of mind,
Searching for solace they cannot find.
Yet every dawn brings a chance to start,
A new melody for the weary heart.
